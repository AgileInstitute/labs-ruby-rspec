===============

This contains the Essential Test-Driven Development labs in Ruby using rSpec.

Note that TestedTrek's game code is intentionally messy. And MessTrek is messy and untested. These are, after all, intended as course labs! :-)

Thanks to:

* Pat Maddox @patmaddox <pat@rubysteps.com> for pairing with me on the development and refinement of lab and workbook code, and for revealing my new favorite programming language. Shiny!
